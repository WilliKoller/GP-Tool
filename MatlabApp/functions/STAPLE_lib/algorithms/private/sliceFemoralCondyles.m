% SLICEFEMORAL2CONDYLES Slice femoral condyles for use in Kai2014_femur.
% This function is practically identical to 
% Kai2014_femur_fitSpheres2Condyles and it is used in one of the sanity
% checks in a recursive manner.
%
%   CS = sliceFemoralCondyles(DistFemTri, CS, debug_plots)
%
% Inputs:
%   DistFemTri - MATLAB Triangulation object for the distal femur (most 
%       distal third of the bone geometry, normally).
%
%   CS - structure including the reference systems and parameters
%       resulting from the geometrical analysis of the femur. In input it
%       requires a preliminary reference system defined as follow:
%           X0: ant-posterior direction, pointing posteriorly
%           Y0: medio-lateral direction, pointing medially
%           Z0: prox-distal direction, pointing cranially
%       These fields are initialised by Kai2014_femur_fitSphere2FemHead.
%
%   debug_plots - enable plots used in debugging. Value: 1 or 0 (default).
%
% Outputs:
%   CS - update input structure including radii and centres of the spheres
%       fitted to the femoral condyles identified by the algorithm.
%
%   FC_Med_Pts - points identified to belong to the medial femoral condyle.
%
%   FC_Lat_Pts - points identified to belong to the lateral femoral condyle.
