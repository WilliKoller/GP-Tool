% KAI2014_FEMUR_FITSPHERES2CONDYLES Slice the distal part of the femoral
% geometries using planes perpendicular to the anterio-posterior direction.
% It starts from the most posterior point of the condyles, that is normally
% on the medial condyle. This point, and the geometrical operations, are
% performed relying on the reference system X0-Y0-Z0 defined in 
% Kai2014_femur_fitSphere2FemHead.m, which has proved reliable in our
% tests. 
% The function assumes that the first slice(s) will only produce one
% slicing area (cutting just the medial condyle), then two slicing areas
% (cutting plane reaching also lateral condyles) and when the slicing
% profile is again a single area the function will stop, assuming the
% entire condyles have been slices. At that point each condyles will be
% fit using a spherical least-squares fit.
% Despite the simplicity of the algorithm, several things can go wrong,
% especially if a low-quality mesh is being processed, so there are
% multiple checks for ensuring that the cuts are being performed in the
% correct directions and according to the algorithm.
%
%   CS = Kai2014_femur_fitSpheres2Condyles(DistFemTri, CS, debug_plots)
%
% Inputs:
%   DistFemTri - MATLAB Triangulation object for the distal femur (most 
%       distal third of the bone geometry, normally).
%
%   CS - structure including the reference systems and parameters
%       resulting from the geometrical analysis of the femur. In input it
%       requires a preliminary reference system defined as follow:
%           X0: ant-posterior direction, pointing posteriorly
%           Y0: medio-lateral direction, pointing medially
%           Z0: prox-distal direction, pointing cranially
%       These fields are initialised by Kai2014_femur_fitSphere2FemHead.
%
%   debug_plots - enable plots used in debugging. Value: 1 or 0 (default).
%
% Outputs:
%   CS - update input structure including radii and centres of the spheres
%       fitted to the femoral condyles identified by the algorithm.
